# Mission Log: Session Debrief

This document summarizes the actions and solutions executed by Agent Goku (CLI) under the command of King Gemini.

## 1. Intelligence Assimilation

-   **Action:** Read and assimilated all mission-critical documents from the `memoryfiles` directory, including `GEMINI.md`, `all_instruments_master.md`, and `dhan_tradehull_memory.md`.
-   **Outcome:** Gained full context of Phase 2 objectives, repository structure, and known data risks (e.g., `SEM_EXPIRY_DATE` as string).

## 2. Problem: Critical `KeyError: 'INDEX'` Bug

-   **Symptom:** The system was failing with a `KeyError` and `DH-905` error when trying to fetch NIFTY index data.
-   **Diagnosis:** The `data_fetcher.py` script was incorrectly passing `exchange='INDEX'` to the underlying SDK, which expects `exchange='NSE'` for index data.
-   **Action:** Surgically modified the `get_index_ohlc` function in `data_fetcher.py` to use the correct `exchange='NSE'` parameter.
-   **Outcome:** The root cause of the data fetching error was eliminated, hardening the function for all index types.

## 3. Problem: Scattered Configuration & Brittle File Paths

-   **Symptom:** Core configuration (`ALIAS_MAP`) was located in an operational file (`order_manager.py`), and the instrument file path logic was not robust.
-   **Diagnosis:** This posed a risk for future maintenance and could lead to errors if scripts were run from different directories.
-   **Actions & Outcomes:**
    1.  **Centralized Configuration:** The `ALIAS_MAP` dictionary was moved from `order_manager.py` to the central `config.py` file.
    2.  **Updated Imports:** `order_manager.py` and `data_fetcher.py` were refactored to import `ALIAS_MAP` from its new, single source of truth.
    3.  **Hardened File Paths:** The `_latest_instrument_csv` function in `order_manager.py` was rewritten to be location-aware. It now robustly finds the `Dependencies/all_instrument*.csv` file by calculating the path relative to the project root, making it immune to changes in the current working directory.

## 4. Knowledge Transfer: `step` vs. `lot_size`

-   **Query:** The Commander questioned the meaning of the `step` value in the `ALIAS_MAP`.
-   **Action:** Clarified that `step` represents the **option strike price interval** (e.g., 50 for NIFTY, 100 for BANKNIFTY) and is used to calculate the ATM strike. It is distinct from `LOT_SIZE`.
-   **Outcome:** Ensured full understanding of the system's configuration parameters.
